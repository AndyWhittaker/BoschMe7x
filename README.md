IDA Pro Bosch ME7x C16x Disassembler Helper

This is a very simple plugin for IDA Pro mainly to save a few hours of work. This is also my very first GitHub project and I don't know what I'm doing yet!

This IDA Pro plug-in reads in a Bosch ME7.x binary, asks a few questions and then goes through said binary, trying to disassemble it.
