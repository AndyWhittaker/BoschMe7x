# BoschMe7x
IDA Pro Bosch ME7x C16x Disassembler Helper

This is a very simple plugin for IDA Pro mainly to save a few hours of work. This is also my very first GitHub project and I don't know what I'm doing yet!

This IDA Pro plug-in reads in a Bosch ME7.x binary, asks a few questions and then goes through said binary, trying to disassemble it.

## Built With

This project is written in bad C++ within Microsoft's Visual Studio 2017 community edition.

## Contributing

Please contribute all that you can; I'm not a IDA Pro professional and would like some help digging through the documentation.
